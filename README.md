CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN


Architecture
  Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
  Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

  Express is a backend framework for Node.js suitable for server-side rendering. JavaScript is the language used for client-side scripting that runs in the browser and allows dynamic interactions with web pages. SPAs load once and dynamically update content without full page reloads. They use JavaScript frameworks to create polished and seamless user experiences. NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like format (BSON). It’s schema-less, allowing flexibility in data structure.

Functionality
  How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
  Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

  JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format whereas JavaScript is a full programming language used for client-side scripting. JSON can easily transport data from the JavaScript-based front-end to the NoSQL-based back-end. We regularly refactored code so that it could interact with the database instead of reading static HTML. This makes for an application that can be quickly and easily updated and scaled.
  
Testing
  Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. 
  Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full-stack application.

  HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) define actions on resources. Endpoints are URLs that represent specific resources (e.g., /users, /products). To test whether these are operating securely, we need to implement security testing. The goal of security testing is to ensure secure data transmission (HTTPS), handle authentication, and prevent vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection).

Reflection
  How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? 
  What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

  This course has equipped me with practical skills in full-stack development. I’ve gained proficiency in frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and backend (Node.js, Express) technologies. Full-stack skills are highly sought after by employers and with these skills, I can contribute to end-to-end development, collaborate with teams, and build scalable applications. My ability to work on both frontend and backend makes me adaptable and valuable in diverse projects. In summary, this course has been instrumental in shaping my technical abilities and preparing me for a successful career in web development. I’m excited to apply these skills and continue learning in the ever-evolving field of full-stack development
